### Summary

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a command-line application from scratch as there is not starter code. This is an interface that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with the information stored in the databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. 

This assignments is created to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.
As this is not a deployed project, I have created a walk-through video that demonstrates its functionality which can be found in the links section below.
